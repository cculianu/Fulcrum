/**
 * RollingBloomFilter is a probabilistic "keep track of most recently inserted"
 * set. Construct it with the number of items to keep track of, and a
 * false-positive rate. Unlike CBloomFilter, by default nTweak is set to a
 * cryptographically secure random value for you. Similarly rather than clear()
 * the method reset() is provided, which also changes nTweak to decrease the
 * impact of false-positives.
 *
 * contains(item) will always return true if item was one of the last N to 1.5*N
 * insert()'ed ... but may also return true for items that were not inserted.
 *
 * It needs around 1.8 bytes per element per factor 0.1 of false positive rate.
 * (More accurately: 3/(log(256)*log(2)) * log(1/fpRate) * nElements bytes)
 *
 * This class is adapted from Bitcoin Cash Node sources commit hash:
