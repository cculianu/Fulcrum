/**

Data model for Fulcrum:  (120 column editor width recommended here)

RocksDB: "meta"
  Purpose:  metadata and sanity checks (see Storage.cpp)

RecordFile: "headers"
  Purpose:  Data store for headers.
  Data layout:  Each header is 80 bytes and they are laid out 1 after the other in what is conceptually a huge
  file-backed array. See RecordFile.cpp for how this file format works.

RecordFile: "txnum2txhash"
  Purpose:  Mapping of TxNum -> TxId(hash)
  Data layout: Each TxHash is 32 bytes and the hashes are laid out one after another in what is conceptually a huge
  file-backed array. See RecordFile.cpp.
  Key: record number -> txid_raw_bytes  ; maps a "txnum" to its 32-byte txid. Each tx on the blockchain has a
  monotonically increasing txnum based on where it appeared on the blockchain. Block 0, tx 0 has "txnum" 0, up until
  the last tx N in block 0, which has "txnum" N. Tx 0 in block 1 then follows with "txnum" N+1, and so on.

RocksDB: "blkinfo"
  Purpose:  Allow for undoing on reorg and store some metadata for each block
  Key:  "num_blocks" -> value (uint32) one past the last block height saved (eg the latest valid block_height
  to use above would be one less than this number).
  Key:  block_height (serialized uint32 of the height in question) -> values:  txNum0, nTx
  Discussion:  Undoing involves going to the height to undo, getting the list of scripthashes, then hitting the
  scripthash_history table (and other scripthash related tables) for each one touched and removing the history entry
  for this block.  TODO: Finish this section...

RocksDB: "undo"
  We store max 10-1000 of these or so for undoing on reorg
  Key: block_height (uint32) (see Storage.cpp)
  Value: a serialized structure that captures the undo info (see struct UnfoInfo in Storage.cpp).. such as
  scripthashes, txo outs, txo ins (spends), etc.  The idea is to be able to roll back the utxoset to the state it had
  before this block occurred, as well as roll back the scripthash history and the txids

RocksDB: "scripthash_history"
  Purpose: the place where the history is stored for eg scripthash_status and get_history
  Key: scripthash_raw_bytes (32 bytes)
  -> values: An ordered list of unique txNums: 6-byte txNums (txNum [uint48] , ... ), for all tx's spending from or to
  a scripthash.

RocksDB: "utxoset"
  Purpose: serialize the UTXOSet structure as seen in the sources. loading this involves iterating over entire table.
  Key: "prevouHashoutN (see struct TXO) (40 bytes)
  Value:  8-byte amount , 32-byte hashX .. see struct TXOInfo.

RocksDB: "scripthash_unspent"
  Key: scripthash_raw_bytes + serialized CompactTXO (40 bytes)
  Value: 8-byte amount field (64-bit signed integer)
  Comments: It turns out scanning by prefix over a table is blazingly fast in rocksdb, so we can easily do listunspent
  using this scheme. I tried a read-modify-write approach (keying off just HashX) and it was painfully slow on synch.
  This is much faster to synch.


A note about ACID: (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable)

The above isn't 100% ACID. Abrupt program termination is ok (becasue rocksdb uses journaling internally), so long as
we weren't in the middle of adding a block or applying a block undo which involves writing to more than 1 rocksdb
database at once.  If abrupt termination occurs during these aforementioned critical times (unlikely, but possible),
then the program will consider itself as having a "corrupt" database, and it will refuse to run the next time it is
started and it will require the user to delete the datadir and resynch to bitcoind.  In practice this approach is less
problematic than it sounds since a program crash or power outage would have to occur precisely within a specific ~20ms
timespan (which happens once every ~10 minutes) when the program is busy committing a new block to the db.  There is a
probability of 1 in 30,000 for a random power outage to occur during this time.  Given how rare power outages are, and
how most servers use a battery backup anyway -- this is acceptable.  And what's more: the database is 100% rebuildable
from bitcoind's data store anyway; so even in the unlikely event of database corruption, the user will be able to
recover.
