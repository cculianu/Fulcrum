/// A class that encapsulates a version, be it a protocol version or a bitcoind version. Basically something that
/// can compare "1.0" and "1.2.1" and come up with a lexical comparison (which is what the tuple can do, but if you
/// inherit from tuple you lose structured binding!) -- this is like a tuple basically, with added niceties like
/// defining an "invalid" version (0.0.0), and a .toString().  Can be used with C++17 structured binding, eg:
///     auto [major, minor, rev] = version;
