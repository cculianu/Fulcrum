///
/// 1. In order for the qobj() virtual function below to not fail, all direct derived classes of this base should
///    inherit from this class via virtual inheritance. This ensures only 1 implementation of this base will be attached
///    to all concrete derived classes.  This only affects directly inheriting children (ie all the Mixins in this
///    file).
/// 2. In addition, all inheritance must be public all the way down, otherwise dynamic_cast<QObject *>(this) will fail.
///    See: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/dynamic_cast#Explanation.
///    Likely this is because qobj() in this class can't "see" the derived class inherits from it unless the whole
///    chain of inheritance leading down is public.  This makes sense, actually.
