# Fulcrum Sample Config File
#
# Feel free to edit this file (or a copy of it) and then pass it as a bare
# argument when starting Fulcrum, e.g.:
#
#     $  ./Fulcrum myconfig.conf
#
# The configuration file format for Fulcrum resembles that of bitcoind.conf in
# that it is a simple name = value style file format, with comments denoted by
# `#` characters. Configuration variables are case insensitive and Fulcrum
# completely ignores variable names that it does not understand.
#
# Boolean variables (such as 'debug' or 'syslog' below) may be specified as name
# = 1, name = true, name = false, name = off, etc, or without any '=' sign in
# which case they are interpreted as "true".
#
# Some (but not all) configuration variables below have corresponding command-
# line equivalents (such as -D/--datadir, for example). If a configuration
# parameter is specified both in the conf file as well as the CLI, the CLI arg
# takes precedence and overrides the corresponding conf file parameter. In this
# way, it's possible to override the conf file for a particular run of Fulcrum
# while still "inheriting" the rest of the config file. Say you wanted to test
# Fulcrum against a different daemon, you would then do:
#
#     $  ./Fulcrum myconfig.conf -b 192.168.1.23:45678
#
#
# What follows below are commented-out versions (in many cases set to their
# defaults) of all of the variables you can use to customize the operation of
# Fulcrum. Required parameters have been left uncommented and must be specified
# for Fulcrum to operate correctly.


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BASIC OPTIONS
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Database directory - 'datadir' - REQUIRED
#
# Specifies the directory where to store the database. Be sure the directory is
# on a drive that has 35+ GB of space for mainnet or ~8GB of space for testnet.
# If the directory does not exist, it will be created. It is recommended you use
# an SSD, but an HDD will work as well once synched, however synching will take
# much longer on an HDD.
#
# NOTE: Use native path separators: '/' on Unix, '\' on Windows.
#
datadir = /path/to/a/dir  # Windows: datadir = D:\FulcrumData\mainnet


# Bitcoin daemon RPC host:port - 'bitcoind' - REQUIRED
#
# Specifies a hostname:port for connecting to the bitcoind rpc service. This is
# a required option (along with rpcuser and rpcpassword below). This
# hostname:port would be the same as you specified in your bitcoin.conf file
# under `rpcbind=` and `rpcport=`.
#
bitcoind = 127.0.0.1:8332


# Bitcoin daemon RPC username - 'rpcuser' - REQUIRED (unless rpccookie is specified)
#
# Specifies the username to use for authenticating to bitcoind. This is a
# required option, along with 'bitcoind' and 'rpcpassword'. This option should
# be the same username you specified in your bitcoind.conf file under
# `rpcuser=`. For security, you may want to omit this option from the config
# file and use the RPCUSER environment variable instead (however, the config
# file or any -u/--rpcuser CLI args will take precedence, so if you do want to
# use the environment variable scheme, then be sure to comment-out the below
# line).
#
rpcuser = Bob_The_Banker


# Bitcoin daemon RPC password - 'rpcpassword' - REQUIRED (unless rpccookie is specified)
#
# Specifies the password to use for authenticating to bitcoind. This is a
# required option, along with 'bitcoind' and 'rpcuser'. This option should be
# the same password you specified in your bitcoind.conf file under
# `rpcpassword=`. For security, you may want to omit this option from the config
# file and use the RPCPASSWORD environment variable instead (however, the config
# file or any -p/--rpcpassword CLI args will take precedence, so if you do want
# to use the environment variable scheme, then be sure to comment-out the below
# line).
#
rpcpassword = hunter1


# Bitcoin daemon RPC cookie file location - 'rpccookie' - DEFAULT: Not used
#
# An alternative to using rpcuser= and rpcpassword= is to use .cookie file
# authentication. This should the full path to your .cookie file in your
# bitcoind datadir. Do not specify this at the same time as "rpcuser" and
# "rpcpassword"
#
#rpccookie = /path/to/bitcoind/datadir/.cookie


# Bitcoin daemon poll interval - 'polltime' - DEFAULT: 2.0 seconds
#
# The number of seconds for the bitcoind poll interval. Bitcoind is polled once
# every `polltime` seconds to detect mempool and blockchain changes. This value
# must be at least 0.5 and cannot exceed 30. If not specified, the default is
# 2.0 seconds.
#
#polltime = 2.0


# TCP bind - 'tcp' - DEFAULT: 0.0.0.0:50001
#
# Specifies the TCP interface:port to bind to for Electron Cash clients to
# connect to. Default is 0.0.0.0:50001. Typically on the Electron Cash network
# 50001 & 50002 are for mainnet TCP & SSL and 60001 & 60002 are for testnet TCP
# & SSL, respectively. If you wish to bind to multiple ports, you may specify
# this option multiple times, once for each interface:port combination.
#
# Note: At the present time, outside of Tor proxying, Electron Cash clients
# typically do not like to connect to non-SSL servers -- so using just TCP will
# lead to not very many clients using your server. SSL is highly recommended.
#
# You may specify either IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces.
#
#tcp = 0.0.0.0:50001


# SSL bind - 'ssl' - DEFAULT: disabled (no SSL bind port)
#
# Specifies the SSL interface:port to bind to for Electron Cash clients to
# connect to. Default is to not use SSL. Typically on the Electron Cash network
# 50001 & 50002 are for mainnet TCP & SSL and 60001 & 60002 are for testnet TCP
# & SSL, respectively. If you wish to bind to multiple ports, you may specify
# this option multiple times, once for each interface:port combination.
#
# If you enable SSL you must also specify the 'cert' and 'key' configuration
# parameters (see below).
#
# You may specify either IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces.
#
#ssl = 0.0.0.0:50002


# WS bind - 'ws' - DEFAULT: disabled (no WS bind port)
#
# Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 interface:port to bind to for the Web Socket
# (ws://) port. Typically on the Electron Cash network 50003 & 50004 are for
# mainnet WS & WSS and 60003 & 60004 are for testnet WS & WSS, respectively.
# If you wish to bind to multiple ports, you may specify this option multiple
# times, once for each interface:port combination.
#
# You may specify either IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces.
#
#ws = 0.0.0.0:50003


# WSS bind - 'wss' - DEFAULT: disabled (no WSS bind port)
#
# Specifies the IPv4 or IPv6 interface:port to bind to for the Web Socket Secure
# (wss://) port. Typically on the Electron Cash network 50003 & 50004 are for
# mainnet WS & WSS and 60003 & 60004 are for testnet WS & WSS, respectively. If
# you wish to bind to multiple ports, you may specify this option multiple
# times, once for each interface:port combination.
#
# If you enable WSS you must also specify the 'cert' and 'key' configuration
# parameters (see below).
#
# You may specify either IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces.
#
#wss = 0.0.0.0:50004


# SSL certificate - 'cert' - DEFAULT: None (required for SSL)
#
# Specifies the SSL certificate to use for all SSL ports. The certificate must be
# in PEM format. If using self-signed certs, the .pem file should contain a
# single certificate. If using CA-signed certs, the .pem file should contain the
# full certificate chain (e.g. fullchain.pem).
#
#cert = /path/to/server-cert.pem


# SSL private key - 'key' - DEFAULT: None (required for SSL)
#
# Specifies the SSL private key to use for encryption. At the present time only
# RSA keys are fully supported. EC, DH, and DSA keys are supported, but their
# support is experimental. The file must be in PEM format.
#
#key = /path/to/server-key.pem


# WSS-specific certificate - 'wss_cert' - DEFAULT: None (recommended for WSS)
#
# Similar to `cert`, but will only be applied to `wss` ports. This parameter
# should be a CA-signed fullchain.pem file. This option is intended to allow WSS
# ports to use a CA-signed certificate (required by web browsers), whereas
# legacy Electrum Cash ports may want to continue to use self-signed
# certificates. If this option is specified, `wss_key` must also be specified.
# If this option is missing, then WSS ports will just fall-back to using the
# certificate specified by `cert`.
#
#wss_cert = /path/to/my-ca-signed-wss-fullchain.pem


# WSS-specific private key - 'wss_key' - DEFAULT: None (recommended for WSS)
#
# Similar parameter to `key`, but will only be applied to `wss` ports. Specify a
# private key PEM file to use for WSS. This key must go with the certificate
# specified in `wss_cert` above. If this option is specified, `wss_cert` must
# also be specified.
#
#wss_key = /path/to/my-ca-signed-wss-privkey.pem


# Admin RPC bind - 'admin' - DEFAULT: None
#
# Specifies the listen address and port for the admin RPC service. This service
# is used by the fulcrum_admin script to issue control commands to Fulcrum. As
# such, you should *NOT* bind to an interface and/or port that is publicly
# accessible by the rest of the internet. It is recommended that you bind to the
# loopback interface (e.g. 127.0.0.1 on IPv4). The port parameter used here can
# be given to the fulcrum_admin script via the -p arg. This option may be
# specified more than once to bind to multiple ports and/or interfaces.
#
#admin = 8000   # <-- a port number by itself implies 127.0.0.1
#admin = 127.0.0.1:8000


# HTTP stats bind - 'stats' - DEFAULT: None
#
# Specifies the listen address and port for the "stats" HTTP server. You may hit
# this endpoint with /stats in your browser, and it will serve you some
# JSON-encoded statistics. The /stats endpoint is intended as a convenient way
# to keep track of what your server is up to, how many clients are connected,
# what the load it is, etc. Do *NOT* expose this port to the public! It is for
# your admin use only! The default is to not start any "stats" HTTP servers
# unless you specify this option. This option may be specified more than once to
# bind to multiple ports and/or interfaces.
#
#stats = 8080   # <-- a port number by itself implies 127.0.0.1
#stats = 127.0.0.1:8080


# Syslog mode - 'syslog' - DEFAULT: off (false)
#
# Syslog mode. If on Unix, use the syslog() facility to produce log messages
# (rather than writing to stdout). This option currently has no effect on
# Windows.
#
#syslog = false


# Debug mode - 'debug' - DEFAULT: off for Release builds, on for Debug builds
#
# Specifies that logging should produce extra verbose output, which may be
# useful for diagnostics. This option is the inverse of the 'quiet' option (see
# below). You may specify either 'debug' or 'quiet', but not both.
#
# This option may be specified multiple times. In that case, network 'trace'
# output will also be generated (this is extremely verbose output typically only
# used for development and/or protocol-level troubleshooting.)
#
#debug = false


# Quiet mode - 'quiet' - DEFAULT: on for Release builds, off for Debug builds
#
# Limits logging to the normal messages, without any extra verbose debug info.
# This option is the inverse of the 'debug' option and is the default on release
# builds. You may specify either 'debug' or 'quiet', but not both.
#
#quiet = true


# CheckDB at startup - 'checkdb' - DEFAULT: off (false)
#
# If enabled, database consistency will be checked thoroughly for sanity &
# integrity each time Fulcrum is (re)started. This may take anywhere from 30
# seconds up to a few minutes depending on your system. Under normal operation
# these checks are not necessary but are provided as a debugging tool in case
# you suspect your database files may be corrupt. This also may be specified on
# the CLI via the --checkdb or -C option for a one-time check.
#
#checkdb = false


# Donation address - 'donation'
# - DEFAULT: bitcoincash:qplw0d304x9fshz420lkvys2jxup38m9symky6k028
#
# The server donation address. This address is given to users when they select
# "Help -> Donate to server" from the Electron Cash GUI, and/or clients that
# invoke the "server.donation_address" RPC method. Additionally, it can also be
# used in the banner text file as the $DONATION_ADDRESS substitution variable
# (see the 'banner' conf variable below). No checks are done on the server side
# to ensure this is a valid Bitcoin Cash address, it is just relayed to clients
# verbatim as a text string (80 characters maximum).
#
# If unspecified, the default will be the developer's donation address.
#
#donation = bitcoincash:qplw0d304x9fshz420lkvys2jxup38m9symky6k028


# Server banner text file - 'banner'
# - DEFAULT: Send a static string "Connected to a Fulcrum xx.x server"
#
# The "banner" text file to send to clients when they request the server banner.
# Specify a file path to a server-readable UTF-8 encoded text file (maximum file
# length: 16384 bytes). Typically Electron Cash clients ask for the server
# banner (via the "server.banner" RPC method) when they first connect to your
# server. They then display this text in the "Console" tab of the Electron Cash
# GUI. Some server admins get creative with this file and include ASCII or emoji
# art and other fancy features, while others choose to use the banner text to
# relay technical information about the server, or both.
#
# Banner text file variable substitution:
#
# The server banner text file supports variable substitutions. You may include
# the following special tokens (case sensitive) in your text file which will be
# interpreted and replaced with the appropriate text:
#
#       $SERVER_VERSION    -  Server software version number, short.
#                             e.g.: "1.0" or "1.2", etc.
#       $SERVER_SUBVERSION -  Server software version, long.
#                             e.g.: "Fulcrum 1.0"
#       $DAEMON_VERSION    -  BitcoinD version number, short.
#                             e.g.: "0.20.6" or "1.1.7"
#       $DAEMON_SUBVERSION -  BitcoinD daemon "subversion" useragent string.
#                             e.g.: "/Bitcoin ABC:0.20.6(EB32.0; Bobs_Server)/"
#       $DONATION_ADDRESS  -  The server donation address as configured (see the
#                             section on the 'donation' conf variable).
#
#banner = /path/to/banner.txt


# Anonymize Client IP addresses and TxIDs in logs - 'anon_logs' - DEFAULT: false
#
# If true, client IP addresses and transaction IDs will be hidden from the
# "normal" log level.  The "debug" or "trace" log levels may still contain this
# information in some cases.
#
#anon_logs = false


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PEER DISCOVERY AND PUBLIC SERVER OPTIONS
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Public hostname - 'hostname' - DEFAULT: Local IP address on server
#
# The server's public hostname. This is the hostname that your server will
# announce to clients and to other servers engaged in peer discovery. It is very
# important that you set this option, since if it is not set, the default is to
# just report your local IP address to other servers and to clients. In most
# cases this default is incorrect if your server is behind a firewall. What's
# more, this text is used to identify your server in the Electron Cash GUI, so
# the default will look like a non-human-friendly IP address, which is most
# certainly not what you want. For best results, set this option to the public
# hostname of your server as others would connect to it on the internet,
# preferably this hostname also matches the hostname in your SSL certificate
# (this latter consideration is not required just recommended). You may also
# wish to set 'public_tcp_port' and 'public_ssl_port' as well (see those
# sections in this file).
#
#hostname = fulcrum.bobs-bank.co.uk


# Public TCP port - 'public_tcp_port' - DEFAULT: The first 'tcp' port configured
#
# The server's public TCP port. This, along with 'hostname' and the various
# 'public_*_port' variables are announced to clients and to other servers
# engaged in peer discovery. The default for this variable is to simply use the
# first TCP port specified in the server configuration (if any). If you are
# behind a firewall and doing some port remapping, then you definitely want to
# set this option. This should be the public TCP port as would be used by the
# rest of the internet to connect to your server via an unencrypted TCP
# connection (non-SSL). You may also set this option to 0 to disable reporting
# any TCP port.
#
#public_tcp_port = 50001


# Public SSL port - 'public_ssl_port' - DEFAULT: The first 'ssl' port configured
#
# The server's public SSL port. This, along with 'hostname' and the various
# 'public_*_port' variables are announced to clients and to other servers
# engaged in peer discovery. The default for this variable is to simply use the
# first SSL port specified in the server configuration (if any). If you are
# behind a firewall and doing some port remapping, then you definitely want to
# set this option. This should be the public SSL port as would be used by the
# rest of the internet to connect to your server via SSL. You may also set this
# option to 0 to disable reporting any SSL port.
#
#public_ssl_port = 50002


# Public WS port - 'public_ws_port' - DEFAULT: The first 'ws' port configured
#
# The server's public WS (Web Socket) port. This, along with 'hostname' and the
# various 'public_*_port' variables are announced to clients and to other servers
# engaged in peer discovery. The default for this variable is to simply use the
# first WS port specified in the server configuration (if any). If you are
# behind a firewall and doing some port remapping, then you definitely want to
# set this option. This should be the public WS port as would be used by the
# rest of the internet to connect to your server via an unencrypted Web Socket
# (ws://) connection. You may also set this option to 0 to disable reporting any
# WS port. See also: ws, tor_ws_port
#
#public_ws_port = 50003


# Public WSS port - 'public_wss_port' - DEFAULT: The first 'wss' port configured
#
# The server's public WSS (Web Socket Secure) port. This, along with 'hostname'
# and the various 'public_*_port' variables are announced to clients and to other
# servers engaged in peer discovery. The default for this variable is to simply
# use the first WSS port specified in the server configuration (if any). If you
# are behind a firewall and doing some port remapping, then you definitely want
# to set this option. This should be the public WSS port as would be used by the
# rest of the internet to connect to your server via an encrypted Web Socket
# Secure (wss://) connection. You may also set this option to 0 to disable
# reporting any WSS port. See also: wss, tor_wss_port
#
#public_wss_port = 50004


# Peer discovery - 'peering' - DEFAULT: true
#
# If set, we query other servers for their peer list and attempt to reach out to
# new servers appearing on the network. Normally, Electron Cash clients will
# query your server asking it for its list of servers, so leaving this as true
# means you will be able to return meaningful results to clients about available
# servers on the network.
#
#peering = true


# Peering: announce self - 'announce' - DEFAULT: true if hostname and peering
#                                                are set, false otherwise
#
# You must enable `peering` above and also define a `hostname` for this to have
# an effect. If set to true and the above conditions are met, then your server
# will announce itself to peers and likely appear in their server lists. Setting
# this to true ensures you get more clients connecting to your server.
#
#announce = true



#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TOR Configuration (optional)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This section is optional but if tor_hostname is set and if at least one
# tor_*_port is specified, we will also announce ourselves on the Tor network
# (iff announce=true).  Note Tor won't work unless you also configure a Tor
# proxy on your system, and with it, configure it to also offer a Tor hidden
# service.


# Tor hostname - 'tor_hostname' - DEFAULT: Nothing
#
# If specified, and if you have a Tor proxy configured, and if you have at least
# one of tor_tcp_port and/or tor_ssl_port specified, then we will anounce this
# host via Tor as a .onion host.  Note that this hostname must end in .onion.
#
#tor_hostname=aykwhy6o2o4ixushlonpjooqv73fwx7jqgoreiknnqxuqv4dwffmb7qd.onion


# Tor banner - 'tor_banner' - DEFAULT: Use the regular banner
#
# Tor banner is optional. If unset, will just use the regular banner= setting
# (if any), or a fallback string "Connected to a Fulcrum xx.yy.zz server.". This
# is here in case you want an alternate banner to be shown to users connecting
# to your server via Tor.
#
#tor_banner=/path/to/another/alternate/banner_tor.txt


# Tor TCP port - 'tor_tcp_port' - DEFAULT: Nothing
#
# If set, we will advertise ourselves as living on the .onion tor_hostname above
# and offering this port for incoming TCP connections via Tor. At least one of
# the various tor_*_port variables must be set (along with tor_hostname) in
# order to announce this server via Tor.
#
# This option may not be specified multiple times.
#
#tor_tcp_port = 50001


# Tor SSL port - 'tor_ssl_port' - DEFAULT: Nothing
#
# If set, we will advertise ourselves as living on the .onion tor_hostname above
# and offering this port for incoming SSL connections via Tor. At least one of

# order to announce this server via Tor.
#
# This option may not be specified multiple times.
#
#tor_ssl_port = 50002


# Tor WS port - 'tor_ws_port' - DEFAULT: Nothing
#
# If set, we will advertise ourselves as living on the .onion tor_hostname above
# and offering this port for incoming WS connections via Tor. At least one of
# the various tor_*_port variables must be set (along with tor_hostname) in
# order to announce this server via Tor.
#
# This option may not be specified multiple times.
#
#tor_ws_port = 50003


# Tor WSS port - 'tor_wss_port' - DEFAULT: Nothing
#
# If set, we will advertise ourselves as living on the .onion tor_hostname above
# and offering this port for incoming WSS connections via Tor. At least one of

# order to announce this server via Tor.
#
# This option may not be specified multiple times.
#
#tor_wss_port = 50004


# Tor proxy to use for outbound connections - 'tor_proxy, tor_user, tor_pass'
# - DEFAULT: 127.0.0.1:9050, no username, no password
#
# If you want to discover .onion peers, be sure to configure a Tor daemon to
# run alongside your server.  The default configuration is for the Tor proxy
# port to be 127.0.0.1:9050, no username, no password. If you modified the
# default in your torrc, then specify the settings used here so that Fulcrum
# may use the Tor proxy to discover .onion peers.
#
#tor_proxy = 9050   # e.g. localhost:9050. IP addr or hostname ok too: 10.0.0.1:9150, fooproxy.com:9050, etc.
#tor_user =  # leave this out unless you specified a username in your torrc
#tor_pass =  # leave this out unless you specified a password in your torrc



#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONS USED ONLY DURING INITIAL SYNC
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# UTXO cache = 'utxo_cache' - DEFAULT: 0
#
# If specified, Fulcrum will use a UTXO Cache that consumes extra memory but
# syncs up to to 2X faster. To use this feature, you must specify a memory value
# in MB to allocate to the cache. It is recommended that you give this facility
# at least 500 MB for it to really pay off, although any amount of memory given
# (minimum 64 MB) should be beneficial. Note that this feature is currently
# experimental and the tradeoffs are: it is faster because it avoids redundant
# disk I/O, however, this comes at the price of considerable memory consumption
# as well as a sync that is less resilient to crashes mid-sync. If the process
# is killed mid-sync, the database may become corrupt and lose UTXO data. Use
# this feature only if you are 100% sure that won't happen during a sync.
# The default is off (0). This option only takes effect on initial sync,
# otherwise this option has no effect.
#
#utxo_cache = 0



#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADVANCED OPTIONS
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# BitcoinD number of clients - 'bitcoind_clients' - DEFAULT: 3
#
# The number of simultaneous bitcoin RPC clients that we spawn to connect to
# bitcoind's RPC port. If you raise this value from the default, be sure to also
# specify the option `rpcthreads=` in bitcoind's conf file (or `-rpcthreads=` on
# the CLI) in order to raise the number of concurrent RPC threads that bitcoind
# uses from the default of 4. You may also want to raise the bitcoind
# `-rpcworkqueue=` parameter above the default of 16 as well.
#
# In general, if you are using a recent version of BCHN with its improved
# JSON-RPC performance, increasing this number (and the corresponding
# -rpcthreads option in bitcoind) may yield better parallelism during initial DB
# synch as well as better performance for your clients. This number should not
# exceed the number of cores in your system, however, as performance may suffer
# in that case. Note that Bitcoin Core doesn't parallelize very well on its
# `getblocks` call due to the way it holds a global lock throughout the entire
# call, so if you are on BTC, your mileage may vary with how much extra
# performance you can get from more simultaneous clients specified here.
#
#bitcoind_clients = 3


# BitcoinD request throttling - 'bitcoind_throttle - DEFAULT: 50 20 5
#
# This is an advanced parameter added to Fulcrum v1.0.4 to control and rate-
# limit client spamming of requests that hit bitcoind, e.g.
# 'blockchain.transaction.get'. The rationale for this facility is that it's
# possible for misbehaving clients to choke the system by hitting the server (in
# particular bitcoind) with many expensive, I/O-bound requests per unit time,
# which would degrade the responsiveness of the server to other clients.
#
# This parameter must be specified as a 3-tuple (whitespace or comma-delimited).
# The three items in the tuple are: "burst limit", "low water mark", and "decay
# per second" for the first, second, and third items, respectively. The
# definition of these three parameters is described below:
#
# "burst limit" - The number of simultaneous outstanding bitcoind-bound requests
# a client may send out at once. If a client has outstanding bitcoind-bound
# requests that have not yet returned results, and the number of such requests
# hits this limit, then the client will be throttled for at least 200
# milliseconds, or until the "low water mark" of extant request is reached
# (whichever is longer). In other words, the throttling is achieved by pausing
# all further processing of requests for that client, until either 200 ms
# has elapsed or the "low-water mark" for outstanding requests (default 20) is
# hit. The default value (50) for this burst parameter is a decent value that is
# neither too liberal nor too conservative.
#
# "low water mark" - If a client is paused, then the number of requests that are

# IBD, is on BCH ScaleNet, can be under high load, or is not on the same local
# machine, you may wish to set this to a higher value than the default. This
# value should be at least high enough to allow for time to prepare and download
# large blocks from bitcoind (this is particularly critical if bitcoind is not
# on the same local machine and the connection to it is not particularly fast).
# If you see the error message "bitcoind request timed out" in the log, you may
# wish to set this value higher than the default.
#
#bitcoind_timeout = 30.0


# Bitcoin daemon RPC uses TLS (HTTPS) - 'bitcoind_tls' - DEFAULT: false
#
# If true, connect to the remote bitcoind via HTTPS rather than the usual HTTP.
# Historically, bitcoind supported only JSON-RPC over HTTP; however, some
# implementations such as bchd support HTTPS. If you are using Fulcrum with
# bchd, you either need to start bchd with the `notls` option, or you need to
# specify this option to Fulcrum.
#
#bitcoind_tls = false


# Daemon RPC Passthrough - 'daemon_passthrough_subnets' - DEFAULT: (None)
#
# Specify a comma-delimited list of subnets for which to allow the RPC method
# "daemon.passthrough". This RPC method is potentially dangerous for public
# servers and should only be used for private or trusted networks. It allows
# clients to directly issue RPC commands to the bitcoin daemon.
#
# Clients connecting from one of the subnets specified by this paremeter will
# be allowed to access this RPC method. The default is that no clients are
# allowed.
#
# Examples: 10.10.2.0/24, 128.0.0.0/8, 123.45./16, 99.74.0.0/16

# Keep RocksDB Log Files - 'db_keep_log_file_num' - DEFAULT: 5

#
# db_keep_log_file_num = 5


# Max RocksDB Open Files - 'db_max_open_files' - DEFAULT: 40
#
# The maximum number of database .sst files (table files) to keep open, per
# database (there are 6 databases altogether used in Fulcrum). This limit can be
# used if you know for a fact that your process ulimit is going to be below the
# number of files in the database. The database on main net may be anywhere from
# 500 to 1000 files total for all 6 databases. (As the database grows, new files
# are added.)
#
# Specify a setting of -1 for "unlimited", that is, to keep all database files
# open, so that their indexes remain cached and in memory. This may impact
# memory consumption but it is the fastest possible setting.
#
# See: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Memory-usage-in-RocksDB#indexes-and-filter-blocks

#
# db_max_open_files = 40


# Max RocksDB Memory in MiB - 'db_mem' - DEFAULT: 512.0
#
# Specifies roughly the maximum amount of memory to give to rocksdb. Larger
# values offer better performance, at the expense of memory consumption. Note
# that rocksb's memory consumption may sometimes exceed this value during high
# load; this setting is merely advisory.
#
# Specify a floating-point or integer value in MiB (1 MiB = 1048576 bytes) in
# the range 50 to 2^64. It is not advised to specify large values in excess of
# 50% of total system RAM. The default is a good settings, however even 256
# works well on an SSD. If using an HDD for the datadir, you may want to set
# this value higher than the default.
#
# db_mem = 512.0


# RocksDB use "fsync" - 'db_use_fsync' - DEFAULT: false
#
# This boolean value, if true, tells the rocksdb library to use fsync() calls as
# opposed to fdatasync(). fsync() is slower but works around some potential
# issues in older Linux kernels and the ext4 filesystem.
#
# From the rocksdb documentation:
#
#  " By default, writes to stable storage use fdatasync (on platforms where this
#    function is available). If this option is true, fsync is used instead.
#
#    fsync and fdatasync are equally safe for our purposes and fdatasync is
#    faster, so it is rarely necessary to set this option. It is provided as a
#    workaround for kernel/filesystem bugs, such as one that affected datasync
#    with ext4 in kernel versions prior to 3.7. " - rocksdb/options.h
#
# db_use_fsync = false


# Maximum batch size (per IP) - 'max_batch' - DEFAULT: 345
#
# The maximum size of JSON-RPC batch requests to the server. Set this to 0
# to unconditionally disable JSON-RPC batch requests server-wide.
#
# This configurable limit is in place as a DoS-prevention measure. If nonzero,
# this limit is applied to non-whitelisted clients (clients whose IP is not
# in `subnets_to_exclude_from_per_ip_limits`).
#
# The limit is a total limit for all batch requests active from a particular
# IP address. For example, if max_batch = 99, and there are 4 connections from
# a single IP address, with each client from that IP simultaneously sending a
# batch request of size 25, then it's possible for 1 or more of the requests
# to be rejected (100 > 99).
#
#max_batch = 345


# Maximum transmission backlog size - 'max_buffer' - DEFAULT: 8000000
#
# The maximum size in bytes of the transmission buffer "backlog" (send and
# receive) per client. This limit is a simple sanity check against DoS and/or
# misbehaving clients.
#
# As a client is sent data, it is expected that they will read it in time and
# not let it accumulate on the sending end. If the data backlog exceeds this
# size, then the client is automatically disconnected. The default chosen is a
# good size in practice, but if your server is serving up large address
# histories in excess of 55,000 transactions for a single address, and your
# clients are slow to read and consume this data, then you may want to increase
# this limit.
#
# Note that unlike ElectrumX or ElecronX, this variable does *not* limit the
# size of transaction histories that may be sent to clients. In fact, you may
# set this variable quite low and if clients can read data as it is generated,
# they may receive arbitrarily large histories from your server.
#
# You may not set this number below 64000 (64 KB) or in excess of 100000000
# (100 MB).
#
# Note that as of Fulcrum 1.0.4, you may dynamically adjust this value for all
# connected clients using the 'maxbuffer' FulcrumAdmin command, and it will be
# applied immediately to all connected clients.
#
#max_buffer = 8000000


# Max client connections per IP - 'max_clients_per_ip' - DEFAULT: 12
#
# The maximum number of simultaneous client connections allowed per originating
# IP address. This is a simple DoS control measure to prevent excessive
# connections from 1 computer on the internet. When a client attempts to exceed
# this per-IP limit, connections past the limit will be refused. This DoS
# control measure may backfire, however, if you anticipate many users arriving
# from behind the same NATed IP address. In practice, this rarely happens, but
# if you anticipate that to be the case, feel free to set this parameter higher.
#
# A value <= 0 or an empty value will disable this limit entirely.
#
#max_clients_per_ip = 12


# Max history - 'max_history' - DEFAULT: 125000
#
# The maximum size of the transaction history for a particular address
# (scripthash) that the server will serve to clients, in terms of number of
# transactions. Addresses having a history exceeding this size will not
# participate in subscriptions (the history status returned will be null), and
# `get_history` and/or `listunspent` will return an empty list. From the point
# of view of a client asking for such a large history -- it will be as if the
# address in question has no history at all.
#
# Be careful increasing this limit. The default chosen is already quite generous
# with fewer than 0.0000001% of addresses on mainnet having histories in excess
# of this limit.
#
# This is a performance-saving measure designed to keep excessively large
# address histories from impacting the performance of the server and using up
# resources. Moreover, it can be argued that such users with such
# computationally expensive histories are better served running a full node
# themseleves, rather than relying on a public SPV server and/or light wallet
# system.
#
# Note that there are some addresses on the chain whose histories exceed 7.5
# million transactions. Returning such a large history to clients and/or
# calculating the "status hash" for such a large history takes on the order of
# seconds, and can impact the experience of other users of your server if
# excessive requests are made for such large histories (if this limit were not
# in place).
#
# This value may be set to any positive integer in the range: [1000, 25000000].
#
#max_history = 125000


# Max pending connections - 'max_pending_connections' - DEFAULT: 60
#
# The maximum number of connections that may be simultaneously "pending" before
# new client connections are refused due to the backlog. "Pending" here refers
# to new connections that come in from the OS's TCP/IP stack but haven't yet
# been properly accepted by this software. The default value is 60, which is
# already quite generous. This variable is exposed for troubleshooting and
# debugging purposes and does not normally need to be modified. Valid values are
# in the range: 10 to 9999.
#
#max_pending_connections = 60


# Maximum reorg depth - 'max_reorg' - DEFAULT: 100
#
# The maximum number of blocks we can rewind back on chain reorg. This setting
# defines how many block undo entries we store in the database. Setting this
# above value beyond the default allows for Fulcrum to support >100-block deep-
# reorgs without requiring a resynch, at the expense of some disk space.
#
# Older Fulcrum versions had this value hard-coded to 100, which is now the
# minimum value for this setting. The maximum value you can specify here is
# 500,000 which is an obscenely high value, since one normally doesn't
# anticipate switching to another chain whose most recent common ancestor block
# is >500,000 blocks deep. Note that large values here simply use up more disk
# space and may affect block synch time, but otherwise have no other negative
# effect. If you are on a test chain or are on a network where you anticipate
# reorgs larger than 100 blocks, you may wish to set this value higher than the
# default.
#
# Note: If you do set this number higher than the default, then using the same
# datadir with an older Fulcrum version may lead to wasted disk space, since
# versions of Fulcrum prior to 1.3.2 used a hard-coded value of 100 for
# max_reorg. As such, running a version of Fulcrum prior to 1.3.2 on a datadir
# set up with max_reorg > 100 may mean that the old Fulcrum version will not
# properly clean up old undo entries, thus wasting a little bit of disk space.
# (If you then run a newer Fulcrum version again, however, the situation will
# resolve itself at that time -- so it's not a huge deal; it just is worth
# mentioning here).
#
#max_reorg = 100


# Maximum subscriptions (global limit) - 'max_subs' - DEFAULT: 10000000
#
# The maximum number of simultaneous script hash subscription that the server
# supports. If more than this number of subscriptions is requested by clients
# (unlikely) then the server will refuse new subscription requests. It will then
# kick off a background task to find the most-subscribed IP address and kick all
# the clients coming from that IP, and then clean up the subscription table.
#
# This config parameter was added in Fulcrum 1.0.5 as a measure to prevent
# clients from potentially exhausting server resources.
#
#max_subs = 10000000


# Maximum subscriptions (per-IP address) - 'max_subs_per_ip' - DEFAULT: 75000
#
# The maximum number of script hash subscriptions per IP address. Note that IP
# addresses matching 'subnets_to_exclude_from_per_ip_limits' will not be
# subjected to this limit (they will still be subjected to the global 'max_subs'
# limit, however).
#
# If a client attempts to subscribe beyond this limit for all the connections
# coming from their IP address, it will receive an error message.
#
#max_subs_per_ip = 75000


# Peer IP uniqueness enforcement - 'peering_enforce_unique_ip' - DEFAULT: true
#
# If true (the default) we reject duplicate peers that appear multiple times
# under different hostnames but using the same IP address. Only the first such
# peer is accepted and all the others are rejected and do not appear in your
# server's peer list. This is a sybil attack defense measure and likely you
# should leave it as true.
#
#peering_enforce_unique_ip = true


# Use the fast simdjson JSON parser - 'simdjson' - DEFAULT: true
#
# If specified, enable or disable the new simdjson backend for JSON parsing.
# Simdjson is over 2x faster than the original parser, but since this parser was
# recently added, some users may wish to use the old parser. You may do so by
# spacifying `false` here. This option corresponds to the CLI argument
# `--no-simdjson` which has the negated meaning of this option.
#
#simdjson = true


# Exclusion from per-IP limits - 'subnets_to_exclude_from_per_ip_limits'
# - DEFAULT: 127.0.0.1/32, ::1/128
#
# Specify a comma-delimited list of subnets to exclude from the per-IP limits
# (such as max_clients_per_ip). Clients connecting from one of these subnets
# will not be subjected to any per-IP limits. The default is for any clients
# connecting from localhost (this default is particularly useful if serving via
# Tor, where all clients come from localhost). Set this to the empty string to
# not have any excluded subnets, eg "subnets_to_exclude_from_per_ip_limits =".
#
# Examples: 10.10.2.0/24, 128.101.0.0/16, 123.45., 99.74.0.0/255.255.0.0, ...
#
#subnets_to_exclude_from_per_ip_limits = 127.0.0.1/32, ::1/128


# Disallow deprecated TLS versions - 'tls_disallow_deprecated' - DEFAULT: false
#
# If true, restricts the TLS protocol used by the server to non-deprecated v1.2
# or newer, disallowing connections from clients requesting TLS v1.1 or earlier.
# This option applies to all SSL and WSS ports server-wide.
#
#tls_disallow_deprecated = false


# Log timestamp format - 'ts_format' - DEFAULT: localtime
#
# Specify the log timestamp format, one of: none, uptime, localtime, utc. If
# unspecified, the default is "localtime". Before this option was introduced,
# previous versions of Fulcrum always logged using "uptime".
#
#ts_format = localtime
#


# Tx hash cache size MB - 'txhash_cache' - DEFAULT: 128
#
# Specifies the amount of memory in MB to use for the txhash cache. The txhash
# cache is used to speed up processing for get_merkle, get_history, listunspent,
# and subscribe requests.
#
# On a memory-constrained system you may wish to lower this value, at the
# expense of server responsiveness (lower limit: 20 MB). On a large memory
# system, you may wish to raise this value, to increase server responsiveness
# (upper limit: 2000 MB).
#
# To view the current state of the txhash cache (which is actually divided up
# into 2 separate caches), use the FulcrumAdmin `getinfo` command. The caches
# appear under "storage_stats" -> "caches" and are labelled with the string
# "TxHash" appearing somewhere in their names.
#
#txhash_cache = 128


# Work queue size - 'workqueue' - DEFAULT: 15000
#
# The maximum size of the work queue. Requests from clients that require further
# processing (such as get_merkle, get_history, listunspent, etc) all end up
# being placed in a queue and processed asynchronously by threads in a thread
# pool. The 'workqueue' parameter sets the size of the work backlog before the
# server returns errors to clients. Normally this option does not need to be
# changed, but the parameter is exposed to server admins for testing and
# debugging purposes.
#
# It is an error to set this parameter to less than 10.
#
#workqueue = 15000


# Work queue threads - 'worker_threads' - DEFAULT: 0 (= autodetect # of CPUs)
#
# The maximum number of worker threads that can simultaneously be spawned for
# work queue processing. In most cases you want to leave this option at its
# default (0, meaning autodetect to number of cores on the system), since using
# as many threads as there are cores on the system is the most efficient overall
# setting and leads to optimal server responsiveness and performance.
#
# In general as clients make requests they are processed very quickly and CPU
# impact on the server is minimal on average. You want the server to have access
# to all your cores for when work arrives in a burst -- which is why the default
# is a good setting.
#
# However, this configuration parameter is exposed to admins wishing to cap the
# maximal load that the server can put on the system. Say you have a server with
# 16 physical cores, setting 'worker_threads = 4' will cap the total CPU load on
# the system to 25% (4 out of 16 cores).
#
# You may even wish to experiment with setting this value higher than the number
# of cores on the system since some of the work submitted to the queue is I/O
# bound work (db reads from disk), so it may actually be beneficial to set this
# higher than the number of cores on the system.
#
#worker_threads = 0   # <--- autodetect to number of cores on the system.


# PID file - 'pidfile' - DEFAULT: None
#
# If specified, Fulcrum will write its process ID to this file on startup (and
# the file will be auto-deleted on app-shutdown). Enabling a PID file may be
# useful for admins wishing to integrate Fulcrum with monitoring software.
#
#pidfile = /path/to/fulcrum.pid

# Reusable Payment Address (RPA) Options
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enable RPA indexing - `rpa` - DEFAULT: 1 for BCH, 0 for all other coins
#
# Whether or not to enable the BCH-specific "RPA" index.
#
# See: https://github.com/imaginaryusername/Reusable_specs/blob/master/reusable_addresses.md
#
# This index takes ~42M of space currently on mainnet (but may grow to >3GB as
# the blockchain advances over time).  If this index is enabled, the
# `blockchain.rpa.*` and/or the `blockchain.reusable.*` RPC methods will be
# available to clients, and the `server.features` map will contain an "rpa"
# key to indicate that the server supports RPA.
#
# If unspecified, then the RPA index and associated RPCs will only be enabled
# for BCH, and will be disabled for all other coins.
#
#rpa = 1


# RPA starting block height - `rpa_start_height` - DEFAULT: 825000 for mainnet

#
# Limit the RPA index to start at this block height. Blocks before this height
# will not have their data indexed by the RPA index. The default for mainnet is
# to save space and cycles since before a certain block height, no RPA wallets
# were in existence anyway since RPA had not yet been invented.
#
#rpa_start_height = 825000


# RPA history scan block limit - `rpa_history_blocks` - DEFAULT: 60
#
# For the `blockchain.rpa.get_history` and/or `blockchain.reusable.get_history`
# RPC methods, limit the number of blocks that client can request to scan for RPA
# transactions in a single RPC call to this number of blocks. In other words,
# results will be truncated if the client requests a wider height range in their
# request than this number. The reason for this limit is that clients should be
# making many frequent fast calls to the server so as to maximize the server's
# ability to multiplex requests (many small requests is better than a few larger
# ones when it comes to perceived server responsiveness). Specifying this to be
# a large value (say, >1000) is a potential DoS vector.
#
#rpa_history_blocks = 60


# RPA maximum history results limit - `rpa_max_history` - DEFAULT: `max_history`
#
# This is similar to the configuration option `max_history` (search for it above),
# but it can be independently specified for the RPA subsystem to be larger or
# smaller than the app-level `max_history`.  If unspecified, this option will
# inherit whatever the app-level `max_history` setting is.
#
#rpa_max_history = 125000


# RPA prefix bits minimum - `rpa_prefix_bits_min` - DEFAULT: 8
#
# Affects the minimum "prefix" value that is accepted by the
# `blockchain.rpa.get_history` RPC method, in terms of number of bits. Specify
# a value in the range: [4, 16]. This is a low-level configuration variable and
# the default of 8 should be good for all extant RPA clients. 4 offers a larger
# anonymity set to clients when they perform queries (as they will get more
# haystack to their 1 needled they are looking for), but it comes with a
# performance penalty on the server-side, which is why we set the default
# minimum to 8 in Fulcrum.
#
#rpa_prefix_bits_min = 8
